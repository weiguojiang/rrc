/***** MATCHING *****/

/**
 * Flow table queries
 *
 * Since matching is based on properties of an entry, these declarations
 * are here in ft_entry
 *
 * There are two types of flow table queries:
 *
 * (1) Match a packet:  match packet fields to the entry's match structure;
 * (2) Query for a set of flow entries:  Use meta-match criteria including
 * the entry's match structure as well as cookies, priority or time since added.
 *
 * For core, the first is only needed for the "table" action on packet out,
 * and possibly not even then.  We do not currently optimize for this case.
 *
 * For the second, we can use "flow space" to describe the relationship.
 * This is described more fully elsewhere.  In short: Given a match, M,
 * let FS(M) be the subset of flow space that is determined by the match.
 *
 * The OpenFlow spec refers to a "strict match".  Given a query match, Mq,
 * the strict match is a match, M, (whose priority must be specified and) such
 * that FS(M) == FS(Mq).
 *
 * For a query match, Mq, the "non-strict match" is the set of entries for
 * which each M in the set satisfies FS(M) is a subset of FS(Mq).
