VLAN Notes  -- Coming Soon
    * Untagged traffic goes to basic inteface, e.g., "eth0"
    * Can create a virtual interface for tagged traffic, e.g., "eth0.5"
        This sends all tagged traffic to eth0.5 and it is received off of that port as untagged traffic.
    * ip link add link eth0 eth0.5 type vlan id 5
