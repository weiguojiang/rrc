* Fix endian issues: Parsed IPv4 neighbor L3 addr: 110.74.192.10

* Implement daemon/double fork

* Test packet I/O

* Get debug symbols in orc_brcm


Pre-add/parse ARP tables with RTM_GETNEIGHTBL in /usr/include/linux/neighbor.h

Figure out why MAC addresses on virtual interfaces are random (garbage?)

Support ports with ADMIN UP/DOWN capabilities
    * Track the UP/DOWN state of the virtual interface and push to the driver
    * Need to update the driver API

Add IPv6 support:
    * Mostly in the netlink_mon.c code, but also in the glue_driver interface
    * Look for "/* TODO : support IPv6 */"

Add VLANs support
    * Watch for new interfaces/links, check their VLANs and add then to the ASIC
    * Consider a default VLAN for all ports, e.g., vlan 1
