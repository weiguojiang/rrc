/*
 * Histogram module
 *
 * This module provides histograms with uint32_t keys. Each key is
 * mapped into a bucket (counter). Multiple keys can share a bucket,
 * in which case they will be indistinguishable in the resulting
 * histogram.
 *
 * Only a few of the most significant bits of the key, plus its logarithm,
 * are used to choose a bucket. This means that the number of keys per
 * bucket increases for larger keys. For example, keys 0-31 each have their
 * own buckets, but 128-135 all share one bucket. This is how we are able
 * to support a wide range of keys in a small amount of memory. The important
 * property is that a key differs from the other keys in its bucket by less
 * than 10%.
 *
 * These histograms will be used in datapath code and so must be efficient.
 * The size and shift are not configurable to avoid extra instructions in
 * histogram_inc. For most applications the higher buckets won't be used
 * and so won't be brought into cache, making them basically free.
