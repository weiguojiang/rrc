#ifndef SLOT_ALLOCATOR_H
#define SLOT_ALLOCATOR_H

/*
 * This module implements an allocator for "slots", which are integers in the
 * range [0, N). A common usecase is finding a free index in an array.
 *
 * Allocation is amortized constant time as long as the load factor stays below
 * a fixed fraction (0.99 is reasonable). Deallocation is constant time.
 *
 * The slot allocator can be used as a more efficient alternative to malloc for
 * a fixed maximum number of constant size objects. Here's an example:
 *
 * \code
 *   struct slot_allocator *my_object_allocator;
 *   struct my_object my_objects[MY_OBJECT_COUNT];
 *
 *   void
 *   my_object_allocator_init(void)
 *   {
 *       my_object_allocator = slot_allocator_create(MY_OBJECT_COUNT);
 *   }
 *
 *   struct my_object *
 *   my_object_alloc(void)
 *   {
 *       uint32_t slot = slot_allocator_alloc(my_object_allocator);
 *       if (slot == SLOT_INVALID) {
 *           return NULL;
 *       } else {
 *           return &my_objects[slot];
 *       }
 *   }
 *
 *   void
 *   my_object_free(struct my_object *obj)
 *   {
 *       uint32_t slot = obj - my_objects;
 *       slot_allocator_free(my_object_allocator, slot);
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * A major advantage of the slot allocator over malloc/free is that it supports
 * iteration in address order. This can make iteration over the set of
 * allocated objects an order of magnitude faster by making better use of the
 * cache and prefetcher. Also, iteration doesn't require an extra set of list
 * links.
 *
 * An advantage of the slot allocator over a freelist is that it doesn't store
 * information in deallocated objects. This means the backing memory can be
 * lazily allocated from the kernel as objects are allocated, rather than
 * all at once, reducing memory consumption.
 *
 * The slot allocator attempts to keep allocated slots packed in the lower
 * portion of the range. This improves iteration efficiency and reduces the
 * chance of higher pages of backing memory ever being faulted in.
